> The most direct way to create a string is to write:

# String Length

> Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object. After the following two lines of code have been executed, len equals 17:
> String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
> int len = palindrome.length();
